<h2>Employee Commitment</h2>

Our priority is serving the needs of our customer and our goal is to dispatch work equitably among drivers.
Dispatch schedules are confidential and not open to the perusal or query of drivers.  Drivers must not question dispatchers for information pertaining to dispatch schedules other than their own.  Last minute schedule changes are inherent to our business and are not considered inconvenient or problematic.  Drivers should be flexible and willing to accommodate changing schedule demands.</p>

    <li>Unreliability resulting from repeat occurrences of unscheduled time off may result in loss of work or termination.</li>
